# Movies-ETL
This project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data about Movies from three different sources into existing tables that is connected to a database.

# Resources
* Software: Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks and PostgreSQL
* Libraries: Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy
* Files: Wikipedia Json, Movie Database Metadata, and MovieLens Ratings

# Results
The datasets were able to be cleaned, merged and exported into two new tables into PostgreSQL. The final results created a movies table with 6,052 rows and a ratings table with 26,024,289 rows.
